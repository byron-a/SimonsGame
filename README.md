 # SimonGame
This is a game of pattern retention for as long as you can remember. It is a good brain test.

## Overview
THis is good test of javascript functions and manipulation with DOM, 
A combination of javaScript and JQuery

## How to play
In this game you click any key or button on your keyboard to start,
- then a color beeps
- you click on that color, and another color or the same color beeps again 
- now you have to click the first color that beeped and then the second color that beeped (in that pattern)
- then another color/same beeps(third)
- you click start the pattern from the very first color down to the last.
- if you miss a color during the sequence, you only get warned once(and you should continue exactly where you missed) and then it's game over if you miss again
